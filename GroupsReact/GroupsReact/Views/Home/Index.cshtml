      <h1>Reading Users & Groups</h1>
      <p>
        Certain company data within the Microsoft ecosystem is considered highly sensitive. In order to access this data, your application must
        request the proper permissions from a company administrator. We call these types of permissions admin-restricted.  In this Group Manager
        WebApp, we show how to use the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint to access the list of groups in a company via the <a href="https://graph.microsoft.io">Microsoft Graph</a>;
        reading groups is one example of an action that requires an admin-restricted permission.

        This app uses an <strong>incremental consent</strong> pattern to acquire the necessary permissions.  First, it asks the user for sign-in
        permissions and to read the list of users in their company.  Then, when the user first attempts to read the list of groups in their company's
        tenant, it requests the admin-restricted permissions from the company's administrator.  Most of the relevant logic for this app lives in
        <code>GroupsController.cs</code> and in <code>AccountContoller.cs</code>.
